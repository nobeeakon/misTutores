# misTutores

Project done with https://enhance.dev/. 

To run first install dependencies `npm install`, then `npm start` to run the app.

This project is about letting users evaluate their thesis tutors. Based on the idea of progressive enhancement 
the front-end code is mostly html elements, also includes some web components to add interactivity when needed.
